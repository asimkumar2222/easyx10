/** The X10Appliance class is derived from the abstract class X10DeviceClass. 
 * Itï¿½s purpose is to model the state and behavior of X10 appliance modules.
 * The state of X10 devices are controlled either by device updates coming
 * down from the Device manager from the gui package, or from incoming
 * DeviceEvents published by EventGenerator. X10Applianc objects also implement
 * TriggerTimers to turn lights on and off during a particular time period. It's 
 * important to note that incoming events are processed regardless of whatever
 * Period is set in a TriggeTimer.
