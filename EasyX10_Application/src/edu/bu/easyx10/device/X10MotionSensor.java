/**
 * 
 * The X10Motion sensor class is where X10 motion sensor devices 
 * are created. In addition to inheriting from X10Device and 
 * Device, X10MotionSensor contains a WaitTimer, that stores the 
 * number of seconds to wait before deeming a motion 
 * sensor inactive. When the timer reaches zero, it fires an event 
 * that is processed by the X10MotionSensor that sets itï¿½s state 
 * to inactive. It also contains an ApplianceList, so that it 
 * knows what devices to send DeviceEvents to when motion is detected,
 * a StartTime and EndTime to mark the window during which motion 
 * events should be processed and a boolean so that it can be checked 
 * whether a window time has been defined.
